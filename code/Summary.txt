<font size = "+3" face = "Comic Sans MS">Goal:</font>

<center><font size = "+2" face = "Comic Sans MS">The data model and databases in this project is created based on Craiglist which means all of the informations can be found on Craiglist website. My goal is to create a website like craiglist but difference with the data strcture, classfication and website style. Visiter can freely post and delete the advertisement. All of the updating only by user she or he themself as dropping off the advertisement they post after sold them. After the website finished setting up(probably after term), I'll try to publish the website and try to use actual data and real-time system by living customer instead of fake data.
