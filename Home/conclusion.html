<center><font size = "+2" face = "Comic Sans MS">Aggregate advertisement from five cities and users can add and remove the informations they like. As the conclusion, Firstly,I grid the classifications of different categories in different cities in the same page and user can select the informations user clicked to see more details. Then, I try to Add tag with insert and delete informations from database. For different classification I have differnet input form when inserting. The largest part what I did is insert and delete cycle. If I have more time, I'll add user log in system. For users, they have their own accounts to manager their advertisement.</font></center>
